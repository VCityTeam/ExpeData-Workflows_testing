# Argo workflows python wrappers

- Hera: [on github](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/hera-workflows) and 
  [on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/hera-workflows/). Local 
  [evaluation](Readme.md)
- [couler](https://github.com/couler-proj/couler) provides a unified interface
  on top of Argo Workflows, Tekton Pipelines, and Apache Airflow. Notice that 
  [couler on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/couler/) has 
  [SQLFlow as repository](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow)

For other python wrappers, there seems to confusingly exist many sources e.g. 
(note that [CermakM](https://github.com/CermakM) does not seem to be contributor
of the [Argo Project](https://github.com/orgs/argoproj/people) neither of 
[argoproj-labs](https://github.com/orgs/argoproj-labs/people) and the 
relationship between the [Argo Project](https://argoproj.github.io/) and 
[the argoproj-labs organisation](https://github.com/argoproj-labs) does not seem
 to be documented).
 Nevertheless we have
- [CermakM/argo-client-python](https://github.com/CermakM/argo-client-python) 
  that is mirrored to 
  [argoproj-labs/argo-client-python](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argo-client-python)
- [CermakM/argo-python-dsl](https://github.com/CermakM/argo-python-dsl) that is 
   mirrored to 
   [argoproj-labs/argo-python-dsl](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argo-python-dsl)
- [Pypi's argo-workflows-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/argo-workflows-sdk/) 
  (mind the the trailing SDK in the name) that in fact has 
  [CermakM/argo-python-dsl](https://github.com/CermakM/argo-python-dsl) (mind 
  the trailing DSL) for its HomePage.
