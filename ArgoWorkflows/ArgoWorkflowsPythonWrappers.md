# Argo workflows python wrappers

For Hera workflows tests refer [here](../ArgoWorkflows-Hera/Readme.md)


For other python wrappers, there seems to confusingly exist many sources e.g. (note that [CermakM](https://github.com/CermakM) does not seem to be contributor of the [Argo Project](https://github.com/orgs/argoproj/people) neither of [argoproj-labs](https://github.com/orgs/argoproj-labs/people) and the relationship between the [Argo Project](https://argoproj.github.io/) and [the argoproj-labs organisation](https://github.com/argoproj-labs) does not seem to be documented)

- [CermakM/argo-client-python](https://github.com/CermakM/argo-client-python) that is mirrored to [argoproj-labs/argo-client-python](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argo-client-python)
- [CermakM/argo-python-dsl](https://github.com/CermakM/argo-python-dsl) that is mirrored to [argoproj-labs/argo-python-dsl](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argo-python-dsl)
- [Pypi's argo-workflows-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/argo-workflows-sdk/) (mind the the trailing SDK in the name) refers to [CermakM/argo-python-dsl](https://github.com/CermakM/argo-python-dsl) (mind the trailing DSL) for its HomePage.
